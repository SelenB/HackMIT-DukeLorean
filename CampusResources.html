                         <h3>Understand your requirements.</h3>
                         <p>
                             Notice that every first-year must be taking either a writing or seminar course. If you are taking a writing course, the letter W will be noted in your DukeHub account. Otherwise, please choose a seminar course.

                     <li> 
                         <h3>Choose multiple classes that interest you.
                         </h3>
                         <p>
                             Smaller classes, such as seminar and writing courses, may often fill up quickly depending on its popularity. Make sure that you bookbag a few classes just in case your first choice is full.
